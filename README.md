# Welcome to UniquID

UniquID's peer-to-peer protocol is an enabling technology that deploys modular, atomic, and minimized-trust rules to interconnect networked endpoints.
- _Modular_: the protocol runs at the application layer of edge routers, virtualized servers, containers, mobile phones, and serverless applications. Increasing the number of these nodes expands the availability of the infrastructure.
- _Atomic_: every device hosts the minimal information necessary to authenticate and authorize other peers. With proper optimizations, every rule can be ~65 bytes.
- _Minimized-trust_: the authentication and authorization information is encoded and hashed inside microtransactions, stored on a public ledger.

UniquID is more efficient than traditional IAM for:
- authentication and authorization under unreliable connectivity
- single sign-on between multiple cloud services, IoT, and unmanned devices from different tenants
- authenticated, low-latency machine-to-machine communication

Starting November 2021, UniquID is entirely open-source and free for non-commercial use and experimentation. The system runs using Litecoin Testnet tokens - however, it is blockchain-agnostic and can leverage any other decentralized infrastructure broadcasting public micro-transactions.

## Technical documentation

UniquID goes beyond the traditional concepts of server and client, so we offer several approaches to understand the technology:

[Getting Started](https://github.com/uniquid/docs_getting_started) is a step-by-step guide to deploying your first virtual organization on Amazon AWS to interconnect IoT devices and their cloud services.

[UniquID Architecture](https://github.com/uniquid/docs_architecture) is a comprehensive document to learn the foundational concepts and the critical topics of the protocol.

[Implementation Guide](https://github.com/uniquid/docs_implementation_guide) supports developers integrating UniquID with their systems.
[End-to-end Demo](https://github.com/uniquid/docs_smartmeter_demo) is a guide to deploying a "Sales Demo" using off-the-shelf hardware for a simple smart-meter use case.
