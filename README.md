# Welcome to UniquID

UniquID is an open source Identity and Access Management protocol, built to remove the bottlenecks of centralized authentication and authorization infrastructure.

UniquID's peer-to-peer protocol is an enabling technology to deploy modular, atomic and low-trust networks of endpoints.
- _Modular_: the protocol runs on a distributed network of nodes, hostedy by: edge routers, virtualized servers and containers, mobile phones. Increasing the number of these nodes expands the availability of the infrastructure.
- _Atomic_: every device hosts the minimal information necessary to authenticate and authorize other peers. The size is \~50 bytes per authorized entity.
- _Low-trust_: the authentication and authorization information is encoded and hashed into microtransactions, stored on a public ledger.

UniquID is more efficient than traditional IAM for:
- authentication and authorization under unreliable connectivity
- single sign-on between multiple cloud services, IoT and unmanned devices with different owners
- authenticated, low-latency machine-to-machine communication

Starting November 2021, UniquID is completely open-source and free for non-commercial use or sperimentation. The system runs using Litecoin Testnet tokens, but is blockchain-agnostic and can leverage any other decentralized infrastructure for public micro-transactions.
